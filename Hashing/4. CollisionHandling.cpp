// Collision Handling

// If we know keys in advance, then we can perfect Hashing.

// If we do not know keys, then we use one of the following:
//     1. Chaining Method : Making a Chain of colliding items.
//     2. Open Addressing : Uses the same array and if the position is occupied , we try to put the keys in another slot
//         1. Linear Probing
//         2. Quadratic Probing
//         3. Double Hashing

// **** Birthday Paradox ****
// If there are 23 people in a room then there is a probablity of half value that 2 people have the same birthday. 

// With 23 people the probablity becomes 50%
// and with 70 people the probablity shoots upto 99.9%
